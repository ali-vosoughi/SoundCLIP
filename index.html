            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>What happens when we push audio-visual alignment to its absolute limits? To systematically investigate this question, we needed datasets with granular alignment quality annotations, but existing datasets treat alignment as binary, either synchronized or not. To address this limitation, we developed a comprehensive dataset featuring detailed alignment scores that reveal the hidden spectrum of audio-visual perceptual correspondence. Using these precise scores, we create "superaligned" representations by training exclusively on the most perfectly matched audio-visual pairs, then conduct our systematic investigation into how this extreme alignment transforms perceptual model behavior across retrieval and generation tasks.</p>

            <p>Our findings reveal that the initial architectural type of the encoder determines how it responds to the alignment process. Image-centric encoders demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modal retrieval, but this intensive alignment causes compression of unique linguistic information and reduces the quality of their text description generation. In contrast, text-centric encoders maintain better balance between the two objectives, revealing a fundamental trade-off where excessive alignment with the visual manifold leads to improved retrieval capabilities, but simultaneously reduces the richness of acoustic and linguistic information necessary for quality text description generation.</p>

                            <p>The video takes place in a workshop setting, specifically at Finney's. The background features various tools and materials typically found in woodworking or similar crafts, such as wooden planks, a workbench, and shelves with additional items. There is also signage indicating "Finney's Expert Advice Simple Solutions Beautiful Work" on the wall. In the first scene, an individual wearing glasses and a black shirt with a white apron stands behind a workbench. They are holding a can of paint and appear to be preparing it for use. On the workbench, there is a rectangular piece of wood that looks like a cutting board, along with other tools and materials. A bottle labeled "Paint" is placed nearby, suggesting that painting might be part of their task. The second scene shows the same person continuing to prepare the paint can. This time, they are using their hands to apply the paint onto the cutting board. The environment remains consistent throughout, reinforcing the idea that this is a dedicated workspace for painting tasks. The third scene continues with the individual still engaged in painting. The focus remains on the process of applying the paint, which appears to be a light color given its sheen. The surrounding area includes more tools and materials, maintaining the workshop ambiance. The fourth scene captures another moment where the individual is seen working on the painting process. The lighting seems slightly dimmer than in previous scenes, possibly due to the nature of the work being done. The overall mood remains focused and industrious. The fifth scene returns to the individual standing behind the workbench, now holding a small container that likely contains additional paint or a different type of material. The arrangement of objects and characters suggests a continuation of the painting activity. The final scene shifts to a different angle, showing the individual from a side perspective. The lighting is brighter compared to earlier scenes, emphasizing the ongoing painting activity. The surroundings remain unchanged, reinforcing the continuity of the workshop environment. Overall, the video provides a detailed look into a typical day in a woodworking workshop, focusing on the activities involved in painting.</p>

                            <p>The video begins with a close-up of a person playing a red acoustic guitar on a wooden floor. The lighting is dim, creating shadows and highlighting the guitar's details. The background is dark, emphasizing the subject in focus. As the video progresses, the scene transitions to a wider shot showing the same person from behind, still holding the guitar. The lighting remains consistent, casting soft shadows around the person and the guitar. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly a room or studio, given the presence of what looks like a microphone stand in the background. In the final part of the video, the camera shifts slightly to show more of the person's hands as they play the guitar. The lighting continues to be dim, maintaining the mood of the earlier scenes. The person's movements are deliberate and focused, suggesting a practice session or performance. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in the environment or actions apart from the progression of the shots. The overall atmosphere is one of concentration and musical expression.</p>

                            <h4>Visual Description</h4>
                            <p>The video begins with a view of an old, tall brick tower with pointed arches and decorative elements. The tower has three levels, each adorned with ornate details such as statues and intricate patterns. At the top level, there are two bells hanging from what appears to be a small balcony or ledge. Below this, on the second level, there is another set of bells, also hanging from a similar structure. In the foreground, there's a building with a sign that reads "PITI" in red letters against a white background. To the left side of the frame, part of another building can be seen, which seems to have a more modern appearance compared to the one in the foreground. The scene transitions smoothly into a festive atmosphere, indicated by garlands draped across the lower portion of the image. The sky remains overcast, suggesting it might be a cloudy day. As the video progresses, the focus shifts back to the tower, now showing its full height and detailed architecture. The bells remain visible, and the overall setting remains consistent throughout the video. Towards the end of the video, the camera angle changes slightly, revealing more of the surroundings, including additional buildings and trees. The lighting dims slightly, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light. Throughout the video, the visual elements include the brick tower, the bell towers, the greenery, and the architectural style of the surrounding structures. There are no significant movements apart from the slight change in perspective.</p>

                            <h4>Visual Description</h4>
                            <p>The video begins with a close-up view of a red stand mixer on a kitchen countertop. The mixer is in the process of mixing dough, which appears to be light yellow and slightly sticky. The background shows a granite countertop and some kitchen utensils, indicating that this scene takes place in a home kitchen. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to the dough being mixed by the mixer. The dough is thick and smooth, with visible air bubbles indicating it has been kneaded. The mixer's motor is spinning rapidly as the dough is being incorporated into the bowl. The lighting is bright, illuminating the dough and making its texture more visible. Towards the end of the video, the dough is fully mixed and ready for the next step in the recipe. The mixer continues to spin at high speed, ensuring the dough is well-mixed and evenly spread out. The background remains consistent throughout, showing the same kitchen countertop and utensils. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes or transitions between scenes; the setting and actions remain constant. The overall mood conveyed by the visual elements is one of preparation and cooking, suggesting that the person preparing the dough is likely following a recipe or instructions provided in the video.</p>

                            <h4>Visual Description</h4>
                            <p>The video begins with a close-up of a person's hands playing an electric guitar. The individual is wearing a black shirt and brown pants, seated on what appears to be a bench or chair. The background is out of focus, but it seems to be an indoor setting with artificial lighting. The scene transitions smoothly into the next frame, where the same person is seen holding the same electric guitar. This time, the guitar has a unique design that resembles a long-necked instrument, possibly a custom-built model known as a "Guitar Hero." The guitar features a prominent logo at the bottom that reads "Guitar Hero," indicating its brand identity. The person continues to play the guitar, adjusting their fingers on the fretboard and strumming the strings. In the final part of the video, the person is still engaged in playing the Guitar Hero guitar. They are shown from a slightly different angle, maintaining the same posture and focus on the guitar. The background remains consistent throughout this segment, reinforcing the continuity between scenes. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in the environment or actions; the setting remains unchanged, and the main action revolves around the guitar player and their interaction with the instrument.</p>

                            <h4>Visual Description</h4>
                            <p>The video begins with a close-up of a person's hand holding a black speaker. The background shows a wooden block and a green plastic container on a table, suggesting an indoor setting possibly in a kitchen or workshop. The scene transitions to the speaker being turned off, indicating that it is not currently playing music. Next, the focus shifts to a small circuit board placed on the same table as the speaker. A blue LED light is illuminated, which could be part of an electronic project or experiment. The circuit board has several wires connected to it, some of which are visible and appear to be part of the electronics setup. The video then moves forward to show the same circuit board now powered up by a battery, with the blue LED light still on. This suggests that the circuitry is functioning correctly and is likely part of a larger electronic device or system. In the final segment, the video continues with the circuit board now powered up, showing the blue LED light glowing brightly. The surrounding environment remains consistent with the previous scenes, maintaining continuity between the different stages of the project. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in the actions or events occurring; instead, the sequence of images captures the progression from turning off the speaker to powering up the circuit board and finally illuminating the LED light.</p>

                            <p>The video begins with a person sitting on a chair, wrapped in a maroon blanket or towel. The background features a wooden floor and various plants, creating an indoor setting that appears cozy and lived-in. As the scene develops, the person starts to move around, bending down and adjusting their position slightly. They eventually sit up straight again, still wrapped in the same maroon item. In the next few frames, the person continues to adjust their posture while still wrapped in the blanket. This suggests they are either getting ready for bed or preparing to get out of bed. The room's decor remains consistent throughout, maintaining a warm and homely atmosphere. Towards the end of this segment, the person is seen standing up from the chair, holding the blanket over their head as if it were a hat. This action indicates they might be about to put it back on or have just taken it off. The final frame shows the person walking away from the chair, leaving the scene empty once more. Throughout the video, there are no significant changes in the environment or actions apart from the person's movements. The lighting is soft and natural, suggesting daytime or well-lit indoor conditions. There are no visible texts or subtitles within the video itself.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>Our systematic investigation reveals a fundamental trade-off where excessive alignment with the visual manifold leads to improved retrieval capabilities, but simultaneously reduces the richness of acoustic and linguistic information necessary for quality text description generation.</p>

            <h3>Performance Trade-offs</h3>
            <p>Image-centric encoders (ImageBind, AudioCLIP, Wav2CLIP) demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modal retrieval due to their inherent design for visual alignment, but this intensive alignment causes compression of unique linguistic information and reduces text generation quality. Text-centric encoders (CLAP, Whisper) maintain stronger linguistic authenticity and achieve better balance between retrieval and generation objectives.</p>

            <h3>Architectural Insights</h3>
            <p>The initial architectural type of the encoder determines how it responds to the alignment process. Encoders pre-trained with text supervision maintain stronger generative capabilities than those focused primarily on audiovisual alignment, highlighting the value of language exposure for generation tasks.</p>

            <h3>Pareto Frontier Discovery</h3>
            <p>We establish a clear Pareto frontier for cross-modal learning, providing guidelines for choosing between retrieval accuracy and generative richness based on application needs. This challenges the assumption that stronger cross-modal alignment necessarily benefits all multimodal tasks.</p>

            "raw": "The main object that is sounding in this image is a large, rectangular sign with rounded corners. The sign is primarily in a shade of blue and features yellow text. The text reads \"INDISPENSIA\" in large letters at the top of the sign, followed by smaller text that is not fully legible due to the angle and distance from the camera.\n\nThe sign appears to be mounted on a wall, and the image captures the sound of the sign as it is being struck or hit. The sound is a loud, hollow, and somewhat reverberant resonance that is characteristic of a heavy object striking a solid surface. The sound is amplified by the enclosed space of the room, contributing to a sense of a deep, echoing sound. The specific type of object that is hitting the sign is not visible in the image, and it is not possible to determine the material of the sign or the nature of the sound beyond what has been described.",
            "projected": "The image shows a sign with the text \"INDIGO\" in large, bold letters, followed by the word \"WASHINGTON\" in smaller letters. The sign is designed to look like an orange construction barrel, with a yellow background and the letters in a contrasting color. The sound emitted by the sign is a high-pitched, electronic beeping, which is likely a security alarm or a system alert sound. The specifics of the sound are not entirely clear from the image, but it appears to be a digital or electronic sound.",

            "raw": "The main object in the image is a clock. The clock appears to be a traditional analog clock with a visible face and hands. It is not possible to hear the sound of the clock from the image, but one can infer that it produces the typical ticking sound that is characteristic of an analog clock mechanism. This sound is usually a combination of a low-pitched ticking on the hour and a higher-pitched ticking on the quarter-hour. The ticking sound is generally soft and can be described as a series of metallic or mechanical clicks.",
            "projected": "The image shows a handbell with a clapper. The clapper, which is the part of the bell that strikes the main body of the bell to produce sound, is in the process of being struck by hand. When the clapper is struck, it usually produces a clear and sharp ringing sound. This type of bell is often used in various ceremonies, events, or religious practices for its ability to produce a loud and distinct sound that can be heard by a large audience. The sound produced by the bell in this image would likely be a crisp and resonant ring, possibly with a slight reverberation due to the acoustics of the space where the bell is being struck.",

            "raw": "In the image, the main object that is sounding is a stringed musical instrument. It appears to be an acoustic guitar, which is a type of guitar that produces sound by the vibration of strings when the guitar is played. The sound produced by the guitar is a combination of various frequencies that create a musical melody when the strings are struck by the guitarist's fingers or a pick. The guitar's sound can vary depending on the type of wood used in its construction, the tension of the strings, and the guitarist's technique and style of playing.

It has a rounded top and a flat, slightly narrower base that is attached to a clapper, which is the part that actually strikes the bell to produce the sound. The sound produced by the bell is a clear, ringing tone that reverberates and fades as the vibrations from the striking clapper dissipate. The bell's sound is likely to be rich in overtones, which are harmonics that are produced by the bell's shape and material properties, and these overtones give the bell's sound a complex and nuanced timbre.",

The sound made by these clogs is a distinct hollow thud when the wearer's foot strikes the ground, due to the hollow design of the clogs, which is quite different from the usual \"slap\" sound of other types of footwear. The hollow thud is both resonant and rhythmic, and it can be heard when the wearer walks on hard surfaces or floors. This sound is characteristic of getas and is often associated with traditional Japanese culture and aesthetics.",
            "projected": "The image depicts a scene where a child is playing with a musical instrument. Specifically, the child is holding a small metal object, which appears to be a handbell. Handbells are typically used in music to produce a ringing sound when struck with a mallet or hammer. The sound produced by a handbell is characterized by a clear, metallic ringing that can last for several seconds. The child seems to be either shaking the handbell or striking it with a mallet, causing it to produce this distinctive sound. The sound can be described as bright, high-pitched, and resonant, with a noticeable decay in volume as the ringing progressively fades away. The sound of a handbell can be quite captivating and is often used in various musical genres, including orchestral music and choral singing, to add a sharp and metallic timbre to the ensemble.",
